<div class="jsx-4245974604 listicle-item-content"><p><a href="https://www.empireonline.com/people/quentin-tarantino/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Quentin Tarantino</a>'s terrific twist on the heist-gone-wrong thriller ricochets the zing and fizz of its dialogue around a gloriously intense single setting (for the most part) and centres the majority of its action around one long and incredibly bloody death scene. Oh, and by the way: Nice Guy Eddie was shot by Mr. White. Who fired twice. Case closed.</p>

It might not have been the first to tap this particular trope, but it's head and shoulders above the rest. Murray's snarktastic delivery makes the early going easy to laugh at, but as the movie finds deeper things to say about existence and morals, it never feels like a polemic.</p>

Yet co-writer/director <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/people/paul-king/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Paul King</a> delivered a truly wonderful film bursting with joy, imagination, kindness and just one or two hard stares. How was he going to follow that? Turns out, with more of the same, but also plenty of fresh pleasures. Paddington (bouncily voiced by <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/people/ben-whishaw/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ben Whishaw</a>) matches wits with washed-up actor Phoenix Buchanan (<a href="https://www.empireonline.com/people/hugh-grant/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hugh Grant</a>, chewing scenery like fine steak), being framed for theft and getting sent to prison. Like all great sequels, it works superbly as a double bill with the original.</p>

The reassuringly <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/people/gary-cooper/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gary Cooper</a>-ish rumple of <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/people/tim-robbins/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tim Robbins</a>' face... Odd that a movie which features such harshness and tragedy should remain a feel-good perennial — even odder when you consider it was a box-office flop on release. Few directorial debuts are so deftly constructed; no surprise, then, that <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/people/frank-darabont/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Frank Darabont</a> has yet to top it.</p>

It's closer to a <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/people/michael-mann/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michael Mann</a> crime epic — except instead of <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/people/al-pacino/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pacino</a> and <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/people/robert-de-niro/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">De Niro</a> in a diner, you get a bloke dressed as a bat and a psychotic clown in a police interrogation room.

At once an art movie and a commercial blockbuster, <em>The Godfather</em> marked the dawn of the age of the mega-movie. An icon of the gangster genre, its imprinted in popular culture – "Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes", the horse's head in the bed – but the first instalment of Brando's cotton-cheeked patriarch's fight for power is so much more than those moments. With performances, style and substance to savour, it's managed to both smash box office records and live on as a staple of cinematic canon.</p>

Not just because the baddies win (temporarily), or because it Force-slammed us with that twist ("No, I am your father"). Empire super-stardestroys thanks to the way it deepens the core relationships — none more effectively than Han and Leia's. She loves him. He knows. And it still hurts.</p>

Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he... well, you know the rest. It might have taken 20 years for <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/people/peter-jackson/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Peter Jackson</a>'s plucky fantasy to clamber, Mount-Doom-style, to the very pinnacle of our greatest-movies pantheon. But here it is, brighter and more resplendent than ever.<em>The Fellowship Of The Ring</em> contains so much movie. Even at the halfway point, as the characters take a breather to bicker in Rivendell, you already feel sated, like you've experienced more thrills, more suspense, more jollity and ethereal beauty than a regular film could possibly muster up. But Jackson is only getting started. Onwards his adventure hustles, to the bravura dungeoneering of Khazad-dum, to the sinisterly serene glades of Lothlorien, to the final requiem for flawed Boromir amidst autumnal leaves. As <em>Fellowship</em> thrums to its conclusion, finally applying the brakes with a last swell of <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/people/howard-shore/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Howard Shore</a>'s heavenly score, you're left feeling euphoric, bereft and hopeful, all at the same time. <em>The Two Towers</em> has the coolest battle. <em>The Return Of The King</em> boasts the most batshit, operatic spectacle. But Fellowship remains the most perfect of the three, matching every genius action beat with a soul-stirring emotional one, as its Middle-earth-traversing gang swells in size in the first act, then dwindles in the third. This oddball suicide squad has so much warmth and wit, they're not just believable as friends of each other — they've come to feel like they're our pals too.An ornately detailed masterwork with a huge, pulsing heart, it's just the right film for our times — full of craft, conviction and a belief that trudging forward, step by step, in dark days is the bravest act of all. Its ultimate heroes aren't the strongest, or those with the best one-liners, but the ones who just keep going. And so <em>Fellowship</em> endures: a miracle of storytelling, a feat of filmmaking and still the gold standard for cinematic experiences. Right, now that's decided, who's up for second breakfast?</p>
